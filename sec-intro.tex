\section{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}
Before getting lost in many technicalities, here has been reported a small
introduction to the GRAPES library. It is a generic environment for P2P
streaming and it is designed to be usable in different environments and
situations. More details could be found in \cite{disi10-038}.\\
The \textbf{GRAPES} library provides a module,
called net-helper, for managing the communication. 
There have been tackled different problems that increase the complexity on managing the communication in
\textbf{TCP} protocol with respect to what was done in \textbf{UDP}.\\
In \textbf{TCP}, the first problem encountered reguards connectivity.
\begin{itemize}
 \item On the one hand, the \textbf{UDP} protocol is not connection oriented. It uses the same file descriptor for communicating with all hosts.
 \item on the other hadnd, the \textbf{TCP} protocol needs to use multiple file descriptors, one for each connected peer and one for the server.
\end{itemize}
Considering the second point, there have been built a tool for managing such connections, called \textit{Dictionary}.\\
Another not so trivial problem to handle is the simultaneous communication with different peers through different
file descriptors. This problem do not exist in \textbf{UDP} considering that there is a single file descriptor
for communicating with other hosts, whereas in \textbf{TCP} has been straighten out by using a specific
queue structure, called \textit{A-queue}.

\subsection{Dictionary}
This could be considered the key point for management of the connections. It is handled through a hash-table
which relies in an external library, \textbf{libdacav}.\\
